## Individual Reflection Dylan Beyak

For myself I had stage 2 and stage 3 to complete. I did complete those stages with the help I needed from my project team. They were completed on time when they were needed to be. I helped on Stage 1 pick some of the datasets we were doing for the NBA data which helped my project team member be able to finish the writeup and addtional lookup for data on time.

For the approach for this project, I will make sure that I will be vigilant when I am not in charge of a project stage. I did that for stage 1 so my approach will be generally the same. Making sure that I help my team members be able to get their stages done and giving them feedback as soon as possible will result in the best project.

I have asked for help from my teammates since when I was either having a hard time understanding some concept or asked for a review session that was me asking for help. My project team members were able to adapt to that well when I needed additional assistance.

How I can help my teammates moving forward is if they are struggling on any of their stages I will make myself available to help as best as I can to help them out. Even if we assign more of the work to one of our team members on a stage does not mean we dont do anything to help. We make review session and verify work. We make sure if they ask for help that any one of us gives it to them to result in the completed stages.
