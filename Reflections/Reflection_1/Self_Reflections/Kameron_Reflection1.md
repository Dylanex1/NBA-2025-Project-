# Self Reflection 1

So far in the project, I have not had the opportunity to be the main organiser for any of the stages thus far. However I have been constantly reviewing and helping throughout the collection of data and the construction of the ER diagram. I also want to add that communication in this group is
fantastic

So far I have only taken the lead in updating the group timeline and have
only had to ask for approval on certain due dates for completing
parts of the project and review sessions. This task was completed on time
as well as the individual reflection.However,
I am taking the lead on the next two stages. Throughout that process I
intend to collaborate closely with Johnny and Dylan to make sure the
Queries I design align with both of their visions for the project.

I think moving forward I can take an more active role in supporting my
teammates. For example I intend to assist much more with designing the
interface for our database, especially if our group decides to go the GUI
route. Additionally I intend to take a more active role when it comes to
creating and populating our database on the University server.
