# Self Reflection 1 

So far, I have completed all tasks I was assigned. For stage 1, I was the "Organizer", meaning my job was to do the bulk of the work, and ask my team members for feedback and support when I needed it. I completed everything on time and made sure our submission met all requirements. 

In addition to my main role, I assisted with stage 2 by reviewing and strengthening the EER diagram. The team member assigned to that stage did an excellent job, but I offered feedback to help ensure the design was logical. I also asked my team members for input early on when selecting datasets to make sure everyone was on board with the direction we were taking. 

Throughout this stage and the earlier stages, the team and I have made it clear that we will communicate regularly and ask for help when needed. For example, in stage 1 I asked for help with reviewing the final write up, to ensure we all agreed upon what was said. Moving forward, I plan to support the group with regular check ins, helping with heavier tasks, and stepping in whenever someone's workload gets too high. I think our team dynamic is solid, and I'll continue to make sure we stay organized and ahead of deadlines.
