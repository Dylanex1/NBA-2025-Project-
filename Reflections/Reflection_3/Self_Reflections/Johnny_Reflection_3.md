## Self Reflection 3

I completed all the tasks I was assigned. I was responsible for the bulk of the work for Stage 1 and Stage 6, and I made sure to finish my tasks well before the deadline so my group had plenty of time to review my work and make any necessary changes.

I've also continued supporting my teammates throughout this project whenever they needed help. Early on, I helped Dylan revise the EER diagram. He did the majority of the work, but when it came time to normalize the tables, the design needed slight adjustments, which he and I worked through together. In Stage 3, I also helped Dylan with the normalization process using `pandas` in Python. Normalizing actually took a surprising amount of effort, which is why he needed help. For Stage 4, I wrote an English query description for Kameron, though I honestly didn’t do much in that stage. Then in Stage 5, I wrote the SQL for queries 9, 10, and 14 to help Kameron out.

I did ask for help when I needed it. In Stage 1, it took me a while to find suitable datasets, so when I was struggling, I reached out. I also asked for help in Stage 6 with writing SQL for a few queries.

Honestly, there is nothing I would change. We had a great setup. I liked how we divided the work so that each person was responsible for two stages, and each person handled the stages they felt strongest in. I feel this is a good way to work in a group rather than splitting each stage into equal parts across everyone, because having too many people working on the same component can lead to overlapping work, inefficiencies, and a less enjoyable experience overall.
