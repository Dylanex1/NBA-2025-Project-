# Self Reflection 3

I did complete all my tasks that have been assigned to me throughout the entire project. I went above and beyond and made sure to pick up more from my team whenever they needed help on any stage. I made sure that I completed them well before the due date so we could have our project review sessions for each stage before submitting.

I always provided support to my teammates through this project. I would ask if they needed help and when they did need help with part of a stage I would do the work either collaboratively or if they had no time I would pick it up and do it on their timeline they needed it done by. The times I have helped is when we were looking for a dataset in stage 1 with Johnny and I we looked hard for a database together instead of just him. For stage 4 I helped Kameron out doing some english queries so there wasnt so many and this goes for stage 5 as well. The ones I wrote I would also write the query for them too. For stage 6 I helped out Johnny think of the SQL injection plan and helped fill in the queries to our interface for the final part.

I did ask for help from my teammates especially during the normalization part and cleaning part since there was too much to do for stage 3.

There is nothing I would have done differently. I would actually execute the same plan if I had another group project since it worked out so perfect!
