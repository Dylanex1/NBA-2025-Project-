# Group Reflection part 3 


Everyone in the group communicated very well from the start to the very end. Anytime that anyone needed assistance with their stage was called upon and got the required assistance quickly. There was no lack of communication ever in this group.

The work for this project was evenly divided into stages where someone would do the majority and the others would review and add suggestions or help if the stage was tilting. Every stage we did assist each other a lot whoever was in control of that particular stage where everyone was able to practice and do all stages of the project.

Everyone completed their project work on time and in fact on the timeline. There was never anything missed or late and evveryone communicated well on this so all stages even the optional ones had a rough draft, reviewed with a review session for each stage and the final project/report and handed in well before the due date.

We executed what we envisioned perfectly we all picked our strengths and weaknesses and adjusted the stage work accordingly and it worked out very well. This project work of COMP 3380 is hard for a group to achieve and we have done above and beyond every single time. We made sure we were consistent on our work and how well we communicated.
