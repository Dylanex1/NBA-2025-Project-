## Group Reflection 2

Things have not changed much since the first group reflection. Overall, communication within our group is still excellent. Questions are answered quickly, and any problems that we have are solved effectively. When a group member has needed help with their stage, others have been more than willing to help out.

Because we have not experienced any communication issues, there is nothing significant that we feel needs improvement. We have been clear about which member is responsible for each stage, and if anyone is unable to complete their part, they have communicated this early so that others can adjust their schedules to help out.

So far, everyone has completed their assigned work on time. Stage organizers have consistently begun their work early, ensuring that they finish ahead of deadlines and remain considerate of group members’ schedules when asking for help. No adjustments are needed at this point.
