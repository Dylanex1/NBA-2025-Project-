Throughout Stages 4-6 I have taken a more involved role in contributing
to the group. I was assignment to lead stages 4 and 5 and as such
I was responsible for contributing the majority of the queries for our
group. Additionally, every task in these stages was completed on time and
group chemistry and cooperation is higher than ever.

In stage 4 I spent time researching our databases topic so that I could
better craft relevant and interesting queries for the next stage. After
that I spent time crafting 10 queries for our group, while listening and
applying feedback from meetings with my fellow group members. Additionally I used some of my research and background in
Basketball to give input on the other 2 queries added by the other group
members.

In stage 5 I listened to the feedback from stage 4 and
implemented that into the 8 complex queries I made. Additionally during
our teams meetings I helped alter some queries made by my teammates to
help avoid divide by 0 errors. Additionally I showed them some other
functions that could help their queries. However, I needed my teammate to
step in to write the division query and they were happy to take it on and crushed it

Lastly in stage 6 I helped implement a couple queries into our
database in a manner that helps avoid unwanted SQL injection.

Throughout all these stages our team has crushed on the communication
and cooperation fronts. For the future the only thing that I could
think to do is to stay on course and keep delivering consistent quality.
