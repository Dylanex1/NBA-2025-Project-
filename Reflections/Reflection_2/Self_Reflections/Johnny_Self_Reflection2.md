# Self Reflection 2

Personally, this feels a lot like reflection 1. I have completed all tasks I was assigned. I was Organizer for stage 1 and 6. That meant my job was to do the bulk of the work and ask my team members for feedback and support when I needed it. In stage 1, I gathered most of the datasets and wrote most of the stage 1 submission. So far in stage 6, I have done most of the coding, which includes populating the database and building the CLI. I have also done most of the write-up for stage 6.

Now that the project is almost finished, there isn’t much I would change about how I have approached things. However, I'm content with how I've handled the work I've been assigned. I’ve been starting early on my parts, and I’ve been good about asking the group for feedback or opinions, like narrowing down the datasets in stage 1 or making sure everyone agreed on the CLI design and the code structure for stage 6.

Since I’m the Organizer for the final stage, most of the remaining work is on me, but I’m still helping my teammates with the smaller pieces they were assigned. Overall, I'm very happy with the group and proud of what we've done so far.
