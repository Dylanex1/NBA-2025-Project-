### Reflection #2


For this next reflection it has been on stages 4-6. For these stage I did some of the queries for stage 4-5 and some refining of our data and EER diagram to make it correct from past feedback from stage 3. As well describing the SQL injection prevention for stage 6.

The contributions I have done to these stages is that I realized that our EER diagram needed to be updated so I made the changes on the feedback we got back from stage 3 on it. I then realized that our tables had incorrect data linking players and teams to only drafts but drafts are the first team they play on so if they changed they are traded. So I had to make sure the IDs were all matching from the players to their Current team they are on now. I did do a few of the complex queries in stage 5 and did the plan of SQL injection prevention for stage 6.

Personally there are no changes needed to made forward. I have made many contributions and asked repeatedly if there is more work to be done or if I can divide the work more but we all seemed to be good since we had a plan of each person is leading a stage that is who does more work during that stage.

If I keep up the momentum for asking the team who needs help with what and take on even more tasks then I am assigned then this project should go above and beyond expectations as it has been going now.
