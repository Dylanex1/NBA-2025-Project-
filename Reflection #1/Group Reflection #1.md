## Group Reflection #1

So far in this project our group commmunication has been very active and descriptive. Our group was able to coordinate roughly when a stage would be completed and we have made sure to give many reminders to each ohter when a deadline is coming up that needs to be finished. 

There is no improvement on communication that us as a group can perform. We have been very clear about deadlines and if we are able to finish the work givne to us or not and if so we say it early if we need assistance from another member.

The project and all the stages are divided equally so far not everyone has had a chance to do their full amount of work yet but by the next stage for sure everyone will have had an equal amount of work. This is not because anyone is slacking off this is because this is how we chose to divide the work up and we are all satisfied with that. We have all helped finalize each stage up until this point, there is not a member who has done nothing.

Every project team member is completing their work on time so far. How we have assigned the work is there is one member who does the bulk work of a stage and asks for help as needed and the 2 other members will review the stage and adjust it and we will host sessions on the stage that the member has completed and provide improvements on that stage. If there is improvements on the stage the other 2 members will make that change to make it equal.
