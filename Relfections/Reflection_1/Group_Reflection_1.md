## Group Reflection #1

So far in this project, our group communication has been very active and descriptive. We’ve been able to coordinate roughly when each stage would be completed and have made sure to give each other plenty of reminders when deadlines are approaching.

There are no improvements to communication that we as a group can make. We have been very clear about deadlines and whether we are able to finish the work given to us or not, and if not, we let the group know early so another member can assist.

The project and all the stages have been divided equally so far. Not everyone has had a chance to complete their full share of work yet, but by the next stage everyone will have done an equal amount. This isn’t because anyone is slacking off. It’s just how we chose to divide the work, and we’re all satisfied with that. We have all helped finalize each stage up to this point, and there isn’t a member who has done nothing.


Every project team member is completing their work on time so far. We’ve assigned the work so that one member does the bulk of a stage and asks for help as needed, while the other two members review the stage and make adjustments. We also host sessions on the stage that the member has completed to discuss and provide improvements. If there are improvements to make, the other two members handle them to keep the workload equal.
